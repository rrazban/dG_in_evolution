# Î”G in evolution
Scripts to assess the role of protein stability in protein evolution.
`dG_distribution/` houses the scripts to determine when steady state in dG evolution under our evolutionary dynamics framework is reached.
`A-ER_correlation/` houses the scripts to test accuracy of analytical expressions relevant to abundance-evolutionary rate anticorrelation.
